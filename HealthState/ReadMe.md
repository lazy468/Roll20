Commands

!hs - when used without a selection it will toggle the mod functionality ON or OFF and display this as a whisper in chat.

If you have tokens selected when using this command it will cycle through them all and update them with the current color status (useful if you have a whole page of tokens not yet marked). Tokens will update when you change their HP value automatically.


Sidenotes:

- If you have bar1 visible to players the token will not update with a status marker, if you hide bar1 from players it will then update status markers.

- When you toggle the mod OFF it will remove all colored status markers on tokens on the Active Player page only, not specifically the page your currently looking at as a GM.
